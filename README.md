# Android Coding Challenge

Create a full search experience from scratch using the Github API

[https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories)

This search experience will include:
- A list to display search results
    - Display search results in a RecyclerView
- A search box to type your query
    - This should be display results as the user types in text
    - Most popular repositories appear first in the search results
- Statistics about the current search
    - Number of Repositories found
- A facet list for filtering results
    - Filter by topic/language

Required language is Kotlin, but please state in the README if you haven't had much exposure to Kotlin.

Things we might look for:
- Are there tests? We don't expect full test coverage, but at least evidence you know how to write a good test
- A README explaining
    - what you focused on, why, and what you think could be better with more time
    - approximately how much time you spent
    - Explaining which type of tests you chose, and why
- Is the code easy to read
- Are the commit messages small and well written

Extra points for:
- Following an Architectural Pattern e.g. MVVM/MVP/MVI
- Dependency Injection
- Infinite scrolling mechanism
- Clean code
